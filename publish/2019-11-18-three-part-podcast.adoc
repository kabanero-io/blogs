== Part 1: An Introduction to Kabanero

Listen to an introduction into why we created Kabanero as an open source project, how we bring together developers, architects and operations teams, and the value across each persona seeking to adopt Kubernetes in a company today.  Pain points, relationships between open source project choices and between Kabanero and IBM Cloud Pak for Application are all discussed.

In the first of a three-part series, Nate Ziemann introduces Kabanero, an open source project that integrates various open technologies in a way that allows developers, architects and operators to work together to develop cloud-native apps with Kubernetes faster with consistency at scale. He highlights traditional pain points and obstacles that developers face when building with containers and details how Kabanero addresses those problems. The relationship between the open project choices and between Kabanero and IBM Cloud Pak for Applications is also discussed.

== Part 2: Kabanero for the systems architect

Chris Bailey shares the systems architect’s  perspective and how they can build technology standards and policies into the applications their developers are creating.  Learn about how this approach can provide consistency at scale all while enabling developers to focus more on code and less on learning Kubernetes and infrastructure in a cloud-native world.

In this episode, Chris Bailey talks about how systems architects can use the Kabanero open source project to seamlessly build technology standards and policies into the applications their developers are creating. Kabanero brings together foundational open source technologies into a modern microservices-based framework that enables developers, architects, and operation admins to build apps for container platforms from the same starting point. The technology speeds development of applications built for Kubernetes while meeting the technology standards and policies your company defines.
