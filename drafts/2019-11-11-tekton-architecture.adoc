= Tekton Architecture
Mark Nuttall <https://github.com/mnuttall>

== Introduction
This blog post is part of a series about Tekton, the Kubernetes-native CI/CD engine that underpins Kabanero. It leads on from link:https://kabanero.io/blog/2019/11/05/Tekton-Enterprise-CI-CD.html[our previous article], ‘How Tekton can power your Enterprise’s continuous integration & continuous delivery.’ We go into more detail on how Tekton works, look at how it can be integrated into an end-to-end DevOps process and finally look forward to the following articles that will flesh out its use in an enterprise context. 

== Building Blocks
Tekton’s basic building blocks are called Steps and Tasks. A Task represents a discrete, self-contained part of a process. An ordered set of Tasks is called a Pipeline. An example Pipeline is shown in Figure 1. This illustrates how a given Task may require several others to complete before it can proceed. A Task comprises one or more Steps: these are the individual commands to execute. Examples of many standard Tasks can be found today in the Tekton https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog[Catalog].

=== Tekton is a set of Kubernetes Custom Resources
Tekton is a ‘cloud native’ CI/CD system, designed to run on Kubernetes and fit in naturally with existing Kubernetes mechanics. Tekton is implemented as a set of Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), which is the standard Kubernetes extension mechanism. Tekton introduces several new CRDs including Task, Pipeline and PipelineRun. A PipelineRun represents a single running instance of a Pipeline. Creating a PipelineRun causes a single build to be started. As shown in Figure 2 a PipelineRun is responsible for creating a Pod for each of its Tasks, and as many containers within each Pod as it has Tasks. 

[#img:pipeline-run-mapping]

."Tekton runs scripts in containers." Steps map to containers. Tasks map to Pods. PipelineRuns are Pipeline instances – like a single Travis build or Jenkins job. PipelineRuns manage their associated Pods. Pods often share a temporary filesystem backed by a PersistentVolume.

We're often asked to compare and contrast Tekton with other CI/CD systems such as Jenkins and Travis. One short answer is that Tekton is currently optimised for building and deploying cloud-native, microservice-based applications compared to the more general-purpose nature of the older alternatives. Jenkins requires a file, generally called `/Jenkinsfile` in the root directory of a project that contains its build script. Similarly Travis looks for a file `/.travis.yml`. In this way each project tends towards having its own build logic - often with significant overlap with that in parallel projects. Tekton's use of Custom Resources means that a Pipeline must exist in a namespace before it can be used. It is possible to include a `/tekton` directory in each project, and to fetch and install that before each build. However Tekton nudges its users to centralise and standardise build logic, consolidated into a separate repository and managed under its own lifecycle. This standardisation can be beneficial when scaling up to larger numbers of microservices, many of which should share build logic that is identical but for a few substitutable parameters. 

=== Integration with the outside world
Tekton Tasks need to interact with external systems. A very simple Tekton Pipeline is of the form, 

----
git clone
docker build 
docker tag 
docker push
----

This Pipeline clones a Git repository, builds an image from it and pushes that image to an external registry. Tekton's PipelineResource is used to model and interact with external entities such as Git repositories, image registries, Pull Requests, and cloud storage. PipelineResources are used as inputs to and outputs from Tasks. They also support authentication with the systems that they represent. Credentials are stored as Kubernetes Secrets and then referenced from the Kubernetes Service Account used to execute a given Task. PipelineResources collect their credentials from this Service Account. During the initialisation phase of a PipelineRun, credentials are converted from their native form into one suitable for the target system. So for example, Git secrets are converted and merged into a `.gitconfig` file and Docker secrets into `.docker/config.json`.

== Building a DevOps Pipeline
Tekton gives us the pieces that we need to build a useful DevOps pipeline. Figure 3 below shows the high level flows involved. We show a very simple Pipeline without all the linting, testing and image scanning involved in a real world implementation. 

[#img:basic-devops]

In this example, Pipelines are initiated as a result of Git activity by a developer. See Weaveworks' excellent https://www.weave.works/blog/what-is-gitops-really[What Is GitOps Really?] article for more on why this model is increasingly popular. Figure 3 shows a 'webhook' initiating a Tekton Pipeline. Webhooks are outbound HTTP POST messages with a payload specific to the particular event provider. These payloads contain most of the information necessary to kick off a Tekton PipelineRun. We discuss webhooks in a bit more detail below.

The flow in figure 3 shows the now-familiar process of building and publishing an image. The flow then goes on to show the new image being deployed to a target Kubernetes environment. This could be a dedicated namespace on the cluster where Tekton is running, or on one or more completely separate clusters. Deployment can occur immediately after build - for example, to a shared development or test environment - or may occur separately as a result of Git commits to a second repository governing the target deployment environment.

=== Webhooks, Triggers and logs 
Figure 3 raises some further questions:
- How are webhooks established?
- If webhook payloads contain 'most of the information necessary to kick off a Tekton PipelineRun', where does the rest come from?
- How do we know that a Pipeline has run, and where are the logs?

The Tekton https://github.com/tektoncd/dashboard[Dashboard] and https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers[Triggers] projects give some answers. The dashboard provides a web-based user interface for interacting with Tekton and viewing the logs from current and previous PipelineRuns.

The Dashboard https://github.com/tektoncd/experimental/tree/master/webhooks-extension[Webhooks Extension] adds in support for setting up webhooks, and mapping them to Pipelines with the extra information - such as target namespace, target docker registry, annd service account settings that needs to be combined with the webhook payload in order to kick off a new PipelineRun. Finally, the Triggers project introduces a standard way to initiate PipelineRuns from specific events, such as merging a pull request or committing code to a particular branch. Tekton Triggers will be covered in more detail in a future blog post. 

== Summary
We've given a high level overview of Tekton's architecture and design, and shown how it can be adopted into a modern DevOps pipeline. Our plan is for future articles in this series to more provide a more in-depth example, cover the dashboard, webhooks and Triggers, and to look at how the Kabanero project is using Tekton in an enterprise context, with support for the separation of roles and responsibilties between development, administration, and architecture, policy and governance.
